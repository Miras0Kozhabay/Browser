<h1>Web Browser</h1>
<p>A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is <i><a href=http://htmlbook.ru/html/a/href>application software</a></i> for accessing the <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web>World Wide Web</a></i>. When a <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing)>user</a></i> requests a <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page>web page</a></i> from a particular <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page>website</a></i>, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server>web server</a></i> and then displays the page on the user's device. </p>

<p>A web browser is not the same thing as a <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine >search engine </a></i>, though the two are often confused. A search engine is a website that provides <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink >links </a></i> to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.</p>

<p>Web browsers are used on a range of devices, including <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer > desktops</a></i>, <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop >laptops </a></i>, <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer > tablets</a></i>, and <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone > smartphones</a></i>. In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers >most used </a></i> a browser. The most used browser is <i><a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome> Google Chrome</a></i>, with a 64% global market share on all devices, followed by <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(software) >Safari </a></i> with 19%.</p>

<h3>History </h3>
<p> The first web browser, called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb>WorldWideWeb</a>, was created in 1990 by Sir <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee>Tim Berners-Lee</a>. He then recruited <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Pellow>Nicola Pellow</a> to write the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Mode_Browser>Line Mode Browser</a>, which displayed web pages on dumb terminals; it was released in 1991. </p>

  <p> 1993 was a landmark year with the release of <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser) >Mosaic</a></i>, credited as "the world's first popular browser". Its innovative <i>graphical interface</i> made the World Wide Web system easy to use and thus more accessible to the average person. This, in turn, sparked the Internet boom of the 1990s, when the Web grew at a very rapid rate. Marc Andreessen, the leader of the Mosaic team, soon started his own company, <i>Netscape</i>, which released the Mosaic-influenced <i>Netscape Navigator</i> in 1994. Navigator quickly became the most popular browser.</p>

<p>Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. Microsoft was able to gain a dominant position for two reasons: it bundled Internet Explorer with its popular Windows operating system and did so as freeware with no restrictions on usage. Eventually the market share of Internet Explorer peaked at over 95% in 2002.</p>

<p>In 1998, Netscape launched what would become the Mozilla Foundation to create a new browser using the open source software model. This work evolved into the Firefox browser, first released by Mozilla in 2004. Firefox reached a 28% market share in 2011.</p>

<p>Apple released its Safari browser in 2003. It remains the dominant browser on Apple devices, though it did not become popular elsewhere.</p>

<p>Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, which steadily took market share from Internet Explorer and became the most popular browser in 2012. Chrome has remained dominant ever since.</p>
<p>In 2011, the HTTPS Everywhere extension was released, and the NoScript extension received numerous awards. The same year, Mozilla launched the stable version of Tor Firefox for navigating the dark web.</p>

<p>Microsoft released its Edge browser in 2015 as part of the Windows 10 release. (Internet Explorer is still used on older versions of Windows.</p>

<p>In terms of technology, browsers have greatly expanded their HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and multimedia capabilities since the 1990s. One reason has been to enable more sophisticated websites, such as web applications. Another factor is the significant increase of broadband connectivity, which enables people to access data-intensive web content, such as YouTube streaming, that was not possible during the era of dial-up modems.

<h3>Function </h3>
<p> The purpose of a web browser is to fetch content from <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web >the Web</a></i> and display it on a user's device.</p>

<p>This process begins when the user inputs a <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL>Uniform Resource Locator</a></i> (URL), such as https://en.wikipedia.org/, into the browser. Virtually all URLs on the Web start with either http: or https: which means the browser will retrieve them with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). In the case of https:, the communication between the browser and the web server is encrypted for the purposes of security and privacy.</p>

<p>Once a web page has been retrieved, the browser's rendering engine displays it on the user's device. This includes image and video formats supported by the browser.</p>

<p>Web pages usually contain hyperlinks to other pages and resources. Each link contains a URL, and when it is clicked or tapped, the browser navigates to the new resource. Thus the process of bringing content to the user begins again.</p>

<p>Most browsers use an internal cache of web page resources to improve loading times for subsequent visits to the same page. The cache can store many items, such as large images, so they do not need to be downloaded from the server again.[17] Cached items are usually only stored for as long as the web server stipulates in its HTTP response messages.[18]

<h3>Features </h3>
<p> The most popular browsers have a number of <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_feature>features</a></i> in common. They automatically log <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browsing_history>browsing history</a></i> or can be used in a non-logging private mode. They also allow users to set bookmarks and customize the browser with extensions. Some provide a sync service.</p>


<p>Traditional browser arrangement: UI features above page content</p>
<p>Most browsers have these user interface (UI) features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Allow the user to open multiple <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page>pages</a></i> at the same time, either in different browser windows or in different <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_(interface)>tabs</a></i> of the same window.</li>
<li>Back and forward buttons to go back to the previous page visited or forward to the next one.</li>
<li>A refresh or reload and a stop button to reload and cancel loading the current page. (In most browsers, the stop button is merged with the reload button.)</li>
<li>A home button to return to the user's home page.</li>
<li>An address bar to input the URL of a page and display it.</li>
<li>A search bar to input terms into a search engine. (In some browsers, the search bar is merged with the address bar.)</li></ol>
<p>However, the limitations of <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen>touchscreens</a></i> require <i><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_browser>mobile browsers</a></i> to have a simpler UI than desktop versions. The difference is significant for users accustomed to keyboard shortcuts.</p>
